## About:
React Challenge for Alkemy Acceleration where I needed to
build a Web App to create a superhero team using an external
API and display different stats for every member and for the
complete team.

## How to Run:

In the project directory:
1. Install dependencies for Front-End.
```
npm install
```
2. Install dependencies for Back-End.
```
cd backend && npm install
```
3. Add an .env file with the Token from [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/) in /backend directory.
```
ACCESS_TOKEN = API_TOKEN_NUMBER
```
4. Run the Front-End in the development mode.
```
npm run dev
```
5. Run the Back-End in the development mode.
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
